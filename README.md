# Recommendation Systems
One of the most important applications of machine learning is recommendation system. In this repo, I compare the performance of 2 different recommender models on 
[MovieLens](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odedgolden/movielens-1m-dataset) dataset. The first model is a basic Collaborative Filtering model, and the second one is more 
complex [DeepFM](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0239.pdf) model.
